This is my attempt at solving the FizzBuzz problem in C.

This program prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for every multiple of 3, it prints "Fizz".
And for every multiple of 5, it prints "Buzz".
For every number that is both a multiple of 3 and 5 it prints "FizzBuzz".

The program doesn't do anything special. I chose to use a for loop and check modulo conditions.
